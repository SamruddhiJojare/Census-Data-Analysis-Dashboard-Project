  - Explore related insights seamlessly

### 🎛️ Filters & Controls

- 🗂️ **Dropdown Filters** are added to allow:
  - Switching between **state-level** and **city-level** views
  - Selecting specific states/cities to focus on granular data
  - Customizing views based on gender, literacy status, or age group

### 💡 Interactive Tooltips

- 📌 Hover over any chart element (bar, bubble, treemap block, or map marker) to:
  - View additional metrics and contextual insights
  - Get precise data values with visual cues
  - Understand chart legends and color encodings without confusion
